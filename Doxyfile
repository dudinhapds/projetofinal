# Doxyfile 1.9.1

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Gerenciador de Tarefas"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          =

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./doc/

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES then doxygen will create 4096 sub-
# directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format and
# will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this
# option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of source files, where
# putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise causes
# performance problems for the file system.
# The default value is: NO.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO

# If the ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will allow non-ASCII
# characters to appear in the names of generated files. If set to NO, non-ASCII
# characters will be escaped, for example _xE3_x81_x84 will be used for Unicode
# U+3044.
# The default value is: NO.

ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES    = NO

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.
# Possible values are: Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese,
# Chinese-Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (United States),
# Esperanto, Farsi (Persian), Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian,
# Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English messages),
# Korean, Korean-en (Korean with English messages), Latvian, Lithuanian,
# Macedonian, Norwegian, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian,
# Serbian, Serbian-Cyrillic, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish,
# Ukrainian and Vietnamese.
# The default value is: English.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = Brazilian
