# Doxyfile 1.9.1

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Gerenciador de Tarefas"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          =

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./doc/

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES then doxygen will create 4096 sub-
# directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format and
# will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this
# option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of source files, where
# putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise causes
# performance problems for the file system.
# The default value is: NO.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO

# If the ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will allow non-ASCII
# characters to appear in the names of generated files. If set to NO, non-ASCII
# characters will be escaped, for example _xE3_x81_x84 will be used for Unicode
# U+3044.
# The default value is: NO.

ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES    = NO

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.
# Possible values are: Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese,
# Chinese-Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (United States),
# Esperanto, Farsi (Persian), Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian,
# Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English messages),
# Korean, Korean-en (Korean with English messages), Latvian, Lithuanian,
# Macedonian, Norwegian, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian,
# Serbian, Serbian-Cyrillic, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish,
# Ukrainian and Vietnamese.
# The default value is: English.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = Brazilian

# The OUTPUT_TEXT_DIRECTION tag is used to specify the direction in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all generated output in the proper direction.
# Possible values are: None, LTR, RTL and Context.
# The default value is: None.

OUTPUT_TEXT_DIRECTION  = None

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES, doxygen will include brief member
# descriptions after the members that are listed in the file and class
# documentation (similar to Javadoc). Set to NO to disable this.
# The default value is: YES.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the brief
# description of a member or function before the detailed description
#
# Note: If both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the
# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.
# The default value is: YES.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is
# used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found
# as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text
# and the result, after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated
# text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the
# following values are used ($name is automatically replaced with the name of
# the entity):The $name class, The $name widget, The $name file, is, provides,
# specifies, contains, represents, a, an and the.

ABBREVIATE_BRIEF       = "The $name class" \
                         "The $name widget" \
                         "The $name file" \
                         is \
                         provides \
                         specifies \

# If the ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC and REPEAT_BRIEF tags are both set to YES then
# doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief
# description.
# The default value is: NO.

ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC    = NO

# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all
# inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those
# members were ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment
# operators of the base classes will not be shown.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = NO

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO     # CHANGED!

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        =

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    =

# If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter (but
# less readable) file names. This can be useful is your file systems doesn't
# support long names like on DOS, Mac, or CD-ROM.
# The default value is: NO.

SHORT_NAMES            = NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = NO

# If the JAVADOC_BANNER tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret a line
# such as
# /***************
# as being the beginning of a Javadoc-style comment "banner". If set to NO, the
# Javadoc-style will behave just like regular comments and it will not be
# interpreted by doxygen.
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_BANNER         = NO

# If the QT_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the first
# line (until the first dot) of a Qt-style comment as the brief description. If
# set to NO, the Qt-style will behave just like regular Qt-style comments (thus
# requiring an explicit \brief command for a brief description.)
# The default value is: NO.

QT_AUTOBRIEF           = NO

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make doxygen treat a
# multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// comments) as
# a brief description. This used to be the default behavior. The new default is
# to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed description. Set this
# tag to YES if you prefer the old behavior instead.
#
# Note that setting this tag to YES also means that rational rose comments are
# not recognized any more.
# The default value is: NO.

MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = NO
